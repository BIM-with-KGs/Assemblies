1. Take the content in `Assemblies/Minimal` and copy it in your local BHoM installation folder, generally `C:\ProgramData\BHoM\Assemblies`, overriding if prompted.
1. Clone the main BHoM repo on your machine: https://github.com/BHoM/BHoM. You can use [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) to do that.
3. Go in https://github.com/BHoM/RDF_Prototypes/tree/main/Grasshopper%20examples and grab any Grasshopper example file and open it. It should give you no errors.
